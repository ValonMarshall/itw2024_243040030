                        Cardigan is a member of Op Reserve Team A4 and a citizen of Leithanien. Before taking up her current position, she was a member of the Bobsled Patrol Team. After an exceptional performance on her tests, she received permission to join Rhodes Island.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Cardigan is a proactive and confident Operator who carries out both daily tasks and combat missions with vigor. As a member of Reserve Op Team A4, Cardigan is very fond of all her teammates.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Cardigan was born the oldest of five children in the frigid northern region of Leithanien to a mother and father who worked in the forests. Growing up in a comfortable and relaxed household, she had harmonious and intimate relationships with all her family members. When she was a child, she dreamed of becoming a professional skier. With her family's support, she took a shot at her dream, but ultimately failed to succeed. She quit ski training and was recruited by a bobsled patrol team. It was during this time that Cardigan underwent defensive and tactical training.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Before she was recruited by Rhodes Island, she left her hometown, curious about city life. She made her way to the center of Leithanien to seek work, but due to its focus on Arts and her lack of talent for it, as well as her love of sport, she felt the city wasn't a good fit for her. During her stay in Leithanien, she met fellow travelers Steward and Adnachiel and formed a deep friendship with them. Even after the two of them became infected, Cardigan continued to put all her effort into helping her friends make it through, and contacted Rhodes Island to seek treatment for them.
