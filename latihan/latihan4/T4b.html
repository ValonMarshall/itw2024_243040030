             <br>
             <span class="judul2" >6-star Flinger Operator Wiš'adel: </span><br>
             Wiš'adel brings unique talents to the battlefield. Her attacks have increased ATK against the main target and attach an afterimage to it. These afterimages can explode when affected by Wiš'adel's aftershock, dealing Physical damage to all nearby enemies and stunning them for a short time. Upon deployment, Wiš'adel immediately summons a Revenant's Shadow within her attack range and gains Camouflage when near it.
                </p>

            <p><span class="judul2">6-star Core Caster Operator Logos:</span>
            <br>
            Logos deals Arts damage, and his unique talent allows him to further amplify his impact: when attacking a target, he has a chance to also strike another random target within his Attack Range, dealing Arts damage and Slowing them for a certain duration.
            </p>

            <p><span class="judul2" >6-star Bard Civilight Eterna:</span>
